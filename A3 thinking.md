# Understanding A3 thinking
### **Fundamental PDCA concepts**
- Plan step  
 Thoroughly studies a problem or opportunities to understand it from as many viewpoints as possible, analyze(quantitatively) to find the root causes, develop more ideas to remedy the problem/seize the opportunities), come up the plan to implement it  
***(Critical and time-consuming phase, deep understanding the fact of current state)***  

- Do step  
Put the plan into action as immediately as possible and prudent  

- Check step
Measuring the effects of implementation and comparing to the target or prediction  


- Active Step  
Establishing new process or system as the standard if the result is satisfactory or remedial actions if they are not.
PDCA aims to improve long-term performance, rather than just take care of localized problem.
The breakthrough is to establish the true cause-and â€“effect relationships and true countermeasures from recurring.

### **7 elements of A3 thinking** 
- Logical thinking process  
- Objectively  
- Results and process  
- Synthesis, distillation and  visualization
- Alignment  
- Coherence within and consistency across
- System viewpoint  
Promote objectively, encourage synthesis and distillation of most relevant information  

#### Grasp the situation: Clarifying the problem further involves 
-	What should be happening that is not
-	What is not happening but should be

### **Storyline of the A3 problem solving including seven sections** 
Theme: the theme objectively describe the problem addressed in the report   
1. Background (key points need to be considered as follow)  
   - Make the overall context of the situation as clear and as visual as possible
   - Identify  the target audience and write accordingly
   - Provide the necessary information that the audience needs to know before going forward
   - Explain how this topic aligns with company goals
   - Include any other information such as historical data, dates, or names that might help the audience understand the importance of this problem

2. Current condition/Problem statement  
   - Using chart, graphic, table while avoiding text or bulleted lists
   - For example: percent defects, hours of downtime.etc.  

    Key points to be considered  
    - Depict an overview of current state of process
    - Highlight the key factors
    - Identify the real problem(What is it? What is not?) 
    - Quantitative measures to depict current state
    - Summarize relevant info pertaining to current state

3. Goal  
   - How will we know the project is successful at the end
   - what standard or basis for comparison will be used  

   Key points to be considered  
   - Set a clear goal or target
   - Clear measurement of performance
   - how to collect data to late evaluate 
   - check the effectiveness of any action items 

4. Root-cause analysis  
     Key points to be considered  
   - Show the root cause of problem identified in the current state
   - Separate symptoms from cause 
   - Useful technique: 5 whys/Fishbone  
   - Tests need to be performed in order to establish some level of certainty pertaining to cause
   - Summarize the main findings of root cause visually  


5. Countermeasures  
   - make sure to address the potential root causes
   - Identify who will implement the countermeasures
   - Be clear what will be done
   - clarify the due date by which action will be compeleted
   - make the implementation order and location clear  
   
6. Effect confirmation	
7. Follow-up actions

### **The status of A3-Project status** 
- Theme  
  Summary of changes and results as an outcome of problem solving or proposal implementation  
  
- who is conducting the work  
  Both novice and experienced managers

- Analysis  
  More focus on verification of hypothesis and action items

- PDCA  
  Heavy focus on Check and Act, including confirmation of resukts bad follow-up to compelet learning loop


**Storyline of the status A3**  
1. Background   
   High-Level overview
2. Current condition   
   Any change (old feature state has now become the current state) should have already occured  in the new state.  
***Example:***   
 Burndown chart to represent the set of activities over an iteration (before and after state for clarity)  

3. Results (Check phase)  
   Reflect the most important for judging the success of the projects, show more than one metric, such as quality, cost, time dimensions, (Agile:US has been done, velocity and etc..)  
4.
