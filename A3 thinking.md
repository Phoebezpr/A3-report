# Understanding A3 thinking
### **Fundamental PDCA concepts**
- Plan step  
 Thoroughly studies a problem or opportunities to understand it from as many viewpoints as possible, analyze(quantitatively) to find the root causes, develop more ideas to remedy the problem/seize the opportunities), come up the plan to implement it  
***(Critical and time-consuming phase, deep understanding the fact of current state)***  

- Do step  
Put the plan into action as immediately as possible and prudent  

- Check step
Measuring the effects of implementation and comparing to the target or prediction  


- Active Step  
Establishing new process or system as the standard if the result is satisfactory or remedial actions if they are not.
PDCA aims to improve long-term performance, rather than just take care of localized problem.
The breakthrough is to establish the true cause-and â€“effect relationships and true countermeasures from recurring.

### **7 elements of A3 thinking** 
- Logical thinking process  
- Objectively   
Avoiding time-wasting arguments, ecourage to think in scientific and quantitative way  

- Results and process   
  Emphasis on both helps maintain a healthy balance  

- Synthesis, distillation and  visualization
  
- Alignment  
- Coherence within and consistency across
- System viewpoint  
Promote objectively, encourage synthesis and distillation of most relevant information  

#### Grasp the situation: Clarifying the problem further involves 
-	What should be happening that is not
-	What is not happening but should be

### **Three Main Types of A3 reprots**
   A logical order similar to PDCA  style, but emphasis a different part of cycle. 

   ***Comparison of different A3s***  
   
   
   | Focus | Problem Solving | Proposal | Project status |  
   | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |  
   | Theme | Improvements    | Policies, decisions or projects with significant investment and implementation | Summary of changes, results of either problem solving or proposal implementation |  
   | Who will conduct the work | Novice continuing throughout career | Experienced personnel, manager|Novice and experienced manager |  
   | Analysis | Emphasis root-cause, quantitative analysis | Improvement based on current state, mix of quli and quanti | Less analysis, verify hypothesis and action items |  
   | PDCA Cycle | Full PDCA cycle, improvements and verifying results | Heavy focus on Plan, with check and Act embedded in implementation  plan | Heavy focus on Check and Act, confirmation of results and follow-up to complete the learning loop |  
 
1. ### Storyline of the A3 **Problem Solving**  
   Problem-solving A3 is typically written after the Plan, Do and check steps  
   Theme: the theme objectively describe the problem addressed in the report  
  
   1.1. Background (key points need to be considered as follow)  
   - Make the overall context of the situation as clear and as visual as possible
   - Identify  the target audience and write accordingly
   - Provide the necessary information that the audience needs to know before going forward
   - Explain how this topic aligns with company goals
   - Include any other information such as historical data, dates, or names that might help the audience understand the importance of this problem

   1.2.  Current condition/Problem statement  
   - Using chart, graphic, table while avoiding text or bulleted lists
   - For example: percent defects, hours of downtime.etc.  

      Key points to be considered  
    - Depict an overview of current state of process
    - Highlight the key factors
    - Identify the real problem(What is it? What is not?) 
    - Quantitative measures to depict current state
    - Summarize relevant info pertaining to current state

   1.3. Goal  
   - How will we know the project is successful at the end
   - what standard or basis for comparison will be used  

   Key points to be considered  
   - Set a clear goal or target
   - Clear measurement of performance
   - how to collect data to late evaluate 
   - check the effectiveness of any action items 

   1.4. Root-cause analysis  
     Key points to be considered  
   - Show the root cause of problem identified in the current state
   - Separate symptoms from cause 
   - Useful technique: 5 whys/Fishbone  
   - Tests need to be performed in order to establish some level of certainty pertaining to cause
   - Summarize the main findings of root cause visually  


   1.5. Countermeasures  
   - make sure to address the potential root causes
   - Identify who will implement the countermeasures
   - Be clear what will be done
   - clarify the due date by which action will be compeleted
   - make the implementation order and location clear  
   
   1.6. Effect confirmation  
   1.7. Follow-up actions

2. The storyline of A3 **Proposal**  
   Proposal A3 is written during the Plan and before the Do step

   2.1. Background  
   - Identify the target audience and write accordingly  
   - Provide the neccessary infor that the audience needs to know before going forward  
   - How this topic align with the goal  
   - Include any pretinent info (eg:historical data, dates,names that might help audience understand the importance of this problem)  

   2.2. Current Condition  
    - Clearly depict an overview of the current condition in a visiual manner  
    - Highlight the key factors  
    - Identify the main issues in the current state   
    - Use quantitative measures to depict the current status  
    - Pertaining to current condition's information   

    2.3. Analysis 
     - Show the main cause of the problem in the current state  
     - Separate symptoms and opinions from cause and effect determination  
     - Highlight what is wrong or what needs to be changed  
     - Show why the current process or situation can be improved  
     - Build a logical case  

    2.4. Proposal  
     - Clearly state the proposal  
     - List the main alternatives that are up for consideration  
     - Evaluate the alternatives in some fashion, ideally quantitative 
     - Identify the most suitable path for moving forward  
     - Give a clear reason why this option is the best

    2.5. Plan details  
     - Major action items  
     - Who will be involved and where the implementation will take place
     - Establish the basic timing for schedule item  
     - Include how progress will be checked
     - Schedule reflection meetings to evaluate progress
     - Standards for comparison make sense
     - Plan in advance for collecting data  
  ***Note: More detail at P68 ~ 72, example at P70 ~ 72***

3. ### The storyline of A3 **Project status** 
 
    3.1. Background   
    -  Identify the target audience and write accordingly (In Agile development, you can involve team members and stakeholders)  
    - Provide the necessary information that audience need to know before going forward  
    - Explian how this topic align with goals  
    - Include any pertaining information 

    3.2. Current condition   
   In state A3, which invloves any change (old feature state has now become the current state) should have already occured  in the new state.   
   - Clearly depict an overview of the current condition, it would be better if show the before and after states for clearity.  
   - Outline the work that has been performed with respect to timelines and objectives when there is no signifcantly changes
   - Apply quantitative measures as much as possible to depict the current states
   - If additional information is needed to supplement the material in A3  

    ***Example:***   
 Burndown chart to represent the set of activities over an iteration (before and after state for clarity)  
Demonstrate the US that has been completed in the current sprint, which are comply with estimation

    3.3. Results (Check phase) 
    - Use the metrics which are best evaluating progress
    - Make sure the metrics are objective and quantified
    - Present a balanced set of metrics to show the improvement in one area has not been offset in another
    - Accuracy
    - Strive to show what has and whay has not improved  
  
   Reflect the most important for judging the success of the projects, show more than one metric, such as quality, cost, time dimensions, (Agile: US has been done, velocity and etc..)  

    3.4. Remaining issues/follow-up actions  
    - Highlight what actions still need to be completed to finish the project
    - If some results are not in line with expectations, ask why and details either the next step to get to the root cause
    - Consider what impediments and unresolved issues might still exist and what works needs to be done with respect to those items
    - Consider whether any other stakeholders may be affected 
    - Consider unresolved issues related to budget, training and etc..
